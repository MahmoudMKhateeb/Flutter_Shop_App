# Tân Tiến (新進）Shop App

Tan Tien is an e-commerse mobile application, using Neumorphic design in UI to improve UX.

>About the app name: 'Tân Tiến' (新進) is a Vietnamese word means　'rising' or 'up-and-coming'. It also was my grandfather's photography shop name. He opened the shop at a Southern Vietnamese countryside village named 'Rạch Gòi' in Hậu Giang province, the shop was his life's pride until it closed when he passed away. Today, I would like to use the name in memory of him.

## Features
* Users can mark favorite, purchase products and publish their own products on shop.
* Uploaded products can be edited or deleted by their owner.
* Login authentication uses Firebase Authentication.
* All products data, user data, favorite data, cart data... etc. are * stored in Firebase realtime database.
* UI uses Neumorphism degin, supported by my `neumorphic_widget` package on pub.dev (link [here](https://pub.dev/packages/neumorphic_widget)).
